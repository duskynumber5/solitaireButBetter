main isnt doing that much work, however it still houses some key functions to the overall game which may be too much.

the different parts of code are rather encapsulated, but main is still handling parts of overarching functions like grabbing.

somewhat easy to follow, the back and forth between files can lead to some confusion but the functions seem easy to follow. 

I think I just need to go through and tweak different things to see how things change and to better understand the processes. 

the current patterns are state patterns and object patterns, but factory and command patterns could be emplimented in order to
    help with the progressing card logic and even the current as well as the undo behaviors or replay for the game.
