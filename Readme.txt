- State patterns
    I used state patterns to track card states between idle, mouse over, and grabbed. This made it easy
    to make the cards or the grabber react differently depending on the state of the card. It also differentiates
    how the cards react different when they are simply hovered over verses actaully grabbed. 

- Observer patterns
    I used these patterns in order to track mouse movement and which cards had the mouse over it at what time. 
    It helped by allowing each card to act and process the input detection independently. This also allows for features
    like the shadow and any other features I may add. 

- Sequencing patterns
    I used these to iterate over the differnt tables of cards I have whether its loading sprites, placing cards, shuffling
    them, or drawing from the stack. This made it easy to get all the cards in a couple lines as well as make the effect or
    action uniform.

- Postmortem

    I broke up my code into more files for this project which made things feel a lot more clear. I didn't get the chance to
    fix my sprites to make them from one sheet whcih is an optimization that I wanted to make; however, I did rename my sprites
    to make the rank and suit assignment more clear. My main file is a lot shorter which I believe is a big imporvement.

- I didnâ€™t make any of the assets in this project.

- I used the base solitare code we got from lecture as a base and built my code up from it!
